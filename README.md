# shopping-habits-social-media-analysis
"An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing the influence of social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) on shopping habits. The dashboard provides insights into voter responses, gender-based influence, and the most impactful platforms. Key formulas such as AVERAGEIF, SUMIF, NESTED IF, and XLOOKUP are used for data analysis."
## Dataset Used

The dataset used for this project was sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping) and contains information on how social media platforms influence shopping habits. 

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **Number of Voters**: Quantitative data showing how many people voted on their social media influence.
- **Social Media Platforms**: Platforms include Instagram, Facebook, and others.
- **Gender**: Data divided by male and female voters.
- **Influence**: Indicates whether social media influenced voters' shopping habits or not.

The dataset required minimal cleaning and was used directly for analysis in Excel.
## Process

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - The dataset was sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping).
   - The dataset contained information on social media influence, voting data, and gender distribution.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The dataset required minimal cleaning as it was already well-structured and contained only quantitative data.
   - Minor adjustments were made to ensure consistency in formatting.

3. **Formulas Used**:
   - **`AVERAGEIF`**: To calculate the average number of voters who were influenced by each social media platform.
   - **`SUMIF`**: To sum the total number of voters based on different conditions (e.g., influenced vs. not influenced).
   - **`NESTED IF`**: Used for handling complex conditions based on multiple criteria in the data.
   - **`XLOOKUP`**: For advanced lookup functionalities to pull data dynamically into the dashboard.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - The dashboard was built using Excel's native tools, such as pivot tables, charts, and slicers, to visualize the insights.
   - Filters were added to allow users to interactively explore data based on gender, social media platforms, and influence levels.

5. **Analysis & Insights**:
   - The data was analyzed to determine the impact of social media platforms on shopping habits.
   - Gender-based analysis was conducted to see which gender was more influenced by social media.
   - The most influential platforms (Instagram, Facebook) were identified based on voter data.
